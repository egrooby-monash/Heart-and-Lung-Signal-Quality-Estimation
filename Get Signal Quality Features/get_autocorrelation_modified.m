%% Purpose
% A function to extract the truncated and untrancated autocorrelation of the heart sound recordings.
%% Inputs
% audio_data: The audio data from the PCG recording
% Fs: the sampling frequency of the audio recording
% figures: (optional) boolean variable for displaying figures
%% Outputs
% truncated_autocorrelation: the autocorrelation function, truncated from
% the first minimum after the first spike (due to overlap at zero lag) to 5
% seconds later
% untruncated_autocorrelation: the original autocorrelation function
% semi_truncated)autocorrelation: the autocorrelation function, truncated from
% the first minimum after the first spike (due to overlap at zero lag) to
% end of the signal

% Find the envelope of the audio signal using the Hilbert transform

% Low-pass filter the autocorrelation:
