% function [sample_entropy] = get_entropy(truncated_autocorrelation, M, r)
%
% A function to extract the sample entropy of the autocorrelation of a
% heart sound signal. Developed as part of:
% D. Springer et al., "Automated signal quality assessment of mobile
% phone-recorded heart sound signals," JMET, In preparation, 2016
% 
% This function requires the Matlab implementation of the "sampen.m" function from physionet:
% https://physionet.org/physiotools/sampen/
%
%% INPUTS:
% truncated_autocorrelation: The truncated autocorrelation found in the
% function "get_autocorrelation.m"
% M: maximum template length
% r: matching threshold
%
%% OUTPUTS:
% sample_entropy: Sample entropy of the autocorrelation signal

function [sample_entropy] = get_entropy_original(truncated_autocorrelation, M, r)

% Changed from m to M = m+1, as the physionet sampen function needs the maximum dimenstion M
M = M+1;
temp = sampen(truncated_autocorrelation,M,r,0,0,0);

% Again, changed from m to M below:
[sample_entropy]= temp(M);
