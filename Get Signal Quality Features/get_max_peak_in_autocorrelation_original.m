% function [mSQI] = get_peak_in_autocorrelation(untruncated_autocorrelation, Fs, figures)
%
% A function to extract amplitude of the maximum peak in the autocorrelation
% signal between lag values of 0.5 and 2.33 seconds.
% Developed as part of:
% D. Springer et al., "Automated signal quality assessment of mobile
% phone-recorded heart sound signals," JMET, In preparation, 2016
% 
% This function requires the Matlab implementation of the "sampen.m" function from physionet:
% https://physionet.org/physiotools/sampen/
%
%% INPUTS:
% untruncated_autocorrelation: The untruncated autocorrelation of the audio
% data from the PCG recording. Derived in "get_autocorrelation.m".
% Fs: the sampling frequency of the autocorrelation
% figures: optional boolean variable to display figures
%
%% OUTPUTS:
% sample_entropy: Sample entropy of the autocorrelation signal
