% function [sdrSQI] = get_signal_to_noise_psd_score(audio_data, Fs)
%
% A function to extract the sdr signal quality index from:
% D. Springer et al., "Automated signal quality assessment of mobile
% phone-recorded heart sound signals," JMET, In preparation, 2016
%
%% INPUTS:
% audio_data: The audio data of the heart sound recording
% Fs: the sampling frequency of the audio recording. This should be greater
% than 2000 Hz, as this function finds the ratio of the power between
% 20-150 Hz and the power above 600 Hz. In order to have any power above
% 600 Hz, the sampling frequency must be greater than 1200 Hz. 
%
%% OUTPUTS:
% sdrSQI: Spectral distribution ratio between the expected frequencies
% within the fundamental heart sounds and noise

%Get the PSD using Welch's method
%Set window size to 2 seconds, to contain at least one heart cycle
%Set the overlap to 50%
%Set the number of FFT points to roughly the frequency, so that we get about a 1 Hz resolution (which should be acceptable, as we are looking for difference in the spectrum far larger than 1 Hz)

% Find the next greatest power of 2 from the sampling frequency
