# Schmidt-Segmentation-Code
Matlab code for the Schmidt HMM-based heart sound segmentation. An example of the implementation of this code can be found in “run_Example_Schmidt_Script.m”.

This code is derived from the paper:
S. E. Schmidt et al., "Segmentation of heart sound recordings by a 
duration-dependent hidden Markov model," Physiol. Meas., vol. 31,
no. 4, pp. 513-29, Apr. 2010.

Developed by David Springer for comparison purposes in the paper:
D. Springer et al., “Logistic Regression-HSMM-based Heart Sound 
Segmentation,” IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., In Press, 2015.
