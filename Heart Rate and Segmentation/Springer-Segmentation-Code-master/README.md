# Springer-Segmentation-Code
Heart sound segmentation code based on duration-dependant HMM

This is Matlab code to run the heart sound segmentation algorithm as outlined in the publication:

D. Springer et al., "Logistic Regression-HSMM-based Heart Sound
Segmentation," IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., In Press, 2015.

The code includes the feature extraction, training of the duration-dependant HMM,
and the decoding of the most likely sequence of states using an extended Viterbi algorithm.

An example of the code at work can be seen in "run_Example_Springer_Script.m".
