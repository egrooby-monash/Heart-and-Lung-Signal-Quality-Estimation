% Find the beats in a PCG signal using the method developed by Liang et al:
% H. Liang, S. Lukkarinen, and I. Hartimo, Heart sound segmentation algorithm based on heart
% sound envelogram, in Computers in Cardiology, vol. 24, Lund, Sweden, 1997, pp. 105108.
%
% The procedure is:
%
% 1. Extract the Shannon envelope of the PCG signal. This envelope is computed by initially normalising
% the PCG signal, by dividing the waveform by its absolute maximum value, limiting the
% amplitude to between [-1; 1]. Normalise the resulting time series by ensuring zero mean and unit standard deviation.
%
% 2. Locate the peaks in the Shannon envelope waveform, by locating the zero-crossings of the first
% derivative of the waveform, in the positive to negative direction. Exclude those peaks below a
% threshold, set to the 75th percentile value of the waveform.
%
% 3. Find the mean and standard deviation of the time interval between peaks. Set a low-limit and
% high-limit for the interval between beats, based on the mean and standard deviation, setting
% these to the mean +- two standard deviations.
%
% 4. If the interval between adjacent peaks is below the low-limit, there must be an extra, erroneous,
% peak detected. Therefore, select the peak with greater envelope amplitude and discard the other.
%
% 5. If the interval between adjacent peaks exceeds the high-limit, a peak has been missed. Therefore,
% reduce the threshold by one percentage point to find the lost peaks.
%
% 6. Repeat steps 4 to 5 until no peaks lie outside of the low- and high-limits, or until the threshold
% reaches the 20th percentile.
%
% 7. Locate the longest interval between adjacent peaks, marking this as a diastolic region. Find
% the mean diastolic and systolic intervals in both a forward and backward direction from this
% interval. Perform a second pass from the longest identified interval, marking intervals between
% peaks consecutively as either systole or diastole, provided the intervals were within a tolerance of
% the mean systolic and diastolic durations (20% and 40% of systolic and diastolic mean durations,
% respectively). Exclude peaks that violate these tolerances as being artefacts.
