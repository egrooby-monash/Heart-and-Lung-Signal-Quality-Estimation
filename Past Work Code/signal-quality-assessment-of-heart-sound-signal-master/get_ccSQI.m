% function [ccSQI] = get_ccSQI(audio_data, Fs,figures)
%
% A function to extract the cos correlation signal quality index from:
% D. Springer et al., "Automated signal quality assessment of mobile
% phone-recorded heart sound signals," JMET, In preparation, 2016
%
%% INPUTS:
% untruncated_autocorrelation: The untruncated autocorrelation of the audio
% data from the PCG recording. Derived in "get_autocorrelation.m".
% Fs: the sampling frequency of the audio recording
% figures: (optional) boolean variable for displaying figures
%
%% OUTPUTS:
% ccSQI: Correlation between the autocorrelation signal and a fitted sinusoid
